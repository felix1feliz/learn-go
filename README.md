# Learning Go

***IF YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN GO, THIS REPO IS NOT FOR YOU!***

This repo was made so I can learn to use go for backend development. This is my learning path, and is not intended to be used by others, altho, if you see value in my repo, you can use it.

## How to use themes

The default theme is set to "dark-theme". To change the theme you have to go to "/theme.css?set-theme=***{the theme you want}***". The valid themes are:
 - dark-theme
 - light-theme
